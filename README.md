## App - Frankenstein

  Crisvagner, a self-taught young man who seeks to know more and more about the dark world behind React technology, created a monster app, with an almost ugly appearance, from different components, from other apps he found, and brought them to life. The enormous performance and monstrous appearance of the app provoked curiosity in those who saw it.
